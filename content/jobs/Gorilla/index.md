- As a Front End Developer, I utilized cutting-edge technologies such as React, Next.js, Redux, and TypeScript to design and develop products. I also created CSS templates for website pages that were visually appealing and functional.

- I followed Agile-Scrum development methodologies and actively participated in sprint planning and retrospectives. I engaged in client interactions and followed established procedures to develop, test, and implement implementation plans while providing deployment assistance.

- In previous roles, I developed Angular applications utilizing Angular CLI, TypeScript, Git, and RxJS, and utilized Jasmine and Protractor for testing and JSON for storing and exchanging information between browsers and servers.
