- Developed modular and reusable components using React, which has enabled maintainability, scalability, and maximizing rendering efficiency.
- Implemented Redux, which has allowed for centralized state management, unidirectional data flow, optimal component re-rendering, and easier debugging that isolates side effects from the view layer.
- Built an Express server for a RESTful API service, which has enabled the creation of robust and maintainable routes with custom middleware for tasks such as authentication, sessions, and fetching from external data sources.
- Integrated unit testing for front-end interfaces using React Testing library.
